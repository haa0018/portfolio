Development Process and Learnings

 Process
Creating my web portfolio was an enlightening process that allowed me to translate the design in my mind into a digital reality. Initially aiming for a specific design, I found myself adapting along the way. Despite veering a bit from the original plan, I maintained the chosen color scheme and introduced more dynamic animations to bring the site to life. 

 Challenges and Solutions

   - Challenge: Matching the envisioned design with the actual implementation.
   - Solution: While I had to make adjustments, I ensured to retain the chosen color scheme and introduced more mobility and dynamism to the animations.

2. Implementing Typing Animation:
   - Challenge: Implementing the typing font was a new territory for me.
   - Solution: I delved into learning through various YouTube videos, allowing me to successfully integrate the typing animation into the portfolio.

3. Navigating Scroll Animations:
